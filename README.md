# Our project
## Abstract
Our project aims to determine whether and how much drainage **basins**, rivers, **lakes**, glaciers, and coasts have changed in the last decades due to **climate change**. The parameters we are going to focus on are the area covered by water, the shape of the water stream, and possibly, the amount of water provided to the surrounding land; this last aspect, which will be estimated considering vegetation health (that is an effect of the quantity of water received) will allow us to understand also how much water the stream supplies to the surrounding environment and consequently how the evolution of the water stream modifies the environment itself. The final destination of our research is to use the collected data to study possible links with climate change and **predict** how the observed sites will change in the future, considering possible effects on the landscape and the local population.
