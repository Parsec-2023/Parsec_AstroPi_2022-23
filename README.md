# Astro Pi
[Astro Pi - Mission Space Lab](https://astro-pi.org/) is a competition organized by the European Space Agency and the Raspberry Pi Foundation that every year invites small groups of young students like us to design and program in Python a 3-hour-long experiment to run on a modified Raspberry Pi 4 aboard the International Space Station.
## Abstract
We chose to study the Earth's surface ([Life on Earth](https://astro-pi.org/mission-space-lab/guidelines/life-on-earth)): our experiment consists in taking images of the surface from the Astro Pi near infrared camera, calculating NDVI and NDWI (two normalised indexes that are commonly used in remote sensing to assess the health of plants and the levels of water and moisture respectively), estimating the area covered in vegetation and water by manipulating the images and using this data for a series of analyses, such as seeing if the vegetation health and water area are correlated and if it is possible to monitor the sea level rise or to predict the variation of some parameters that may be related to climate change.
# Our work
We decided to split the result of our work into two parts inside two different directories, in order to make the repository less messy and its content easier to understand:
### [Phases 1-3](https://github.com/Parsec2k23/Parsec_AstroPi_2022-23/tree/master/Phase_1-3)
### [Phase 4](https://github.com/Parsec2k23/Parsec_AstroPi_2022-23/tree/master/Phase_4)
### [Final report](https://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/edu/parsec.pdf)
